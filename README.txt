to compile: gcc *.c (I've used commandline MinGW and only Notepad++)

Setting direction 
	east => move right
	west => move left
	north => move up
	south => move down

f = move upward
b = move down
r/l = move right/left.

Speed 1 => 1 "pixel"/second
Speed 10 => 10 "pixels"/second

Think you wanted forward to be right or? Not sure...
Furthermore, not really taking into account the 90 degree turn in respect to current direction etc.
But I think (hope) my code should show my programming "skills" nevertheless.
Not more time to spend on this now.

Enjoy! ;) (could quite easily be adapted to classic Nokia snake game ;)
